# Apartment-Management

This repository is an ASP.NET Core Zero project.

It's already been a built project, our job was just to edit the existing or add some that we needed to satisfy our teacher's ideas (who was acting like a customer).

I will give you the directory tree for which I mainly take responsibility.
In each file, there may be pairs of communication blocks to mark my edited or added codes as below:

	/*
        *   01-2024 Lo Tri Thong
        *   From here
        */

	...

	/*
        *   01-2024 Lo Tri Thong
        *   To here
        */

Here is the directory tree

	/BACKEND
 	  /src
  	    /Framework.Application
	      /Authorization
	        /Accounts
	          /AccountAppService.cs
	        /Users
	          /UserAppService.cs
	    /Framework.Application.Shared
	      /Authorization
	        /Accounts
	          /Dto
	            /ResisterInput.cs
	    /Framework.Core
	      /Authorization
	        /Users
	          /UserEmailer.cs
	          /UserRegistrationManager.cs
	        /AppAuthorizationProvider.cs
	        /AppPermissions.cs
	    /Framework.Core.Shared
	      /Authorization
	        /Users
	          /UserConsts.cs

I have skipped some tiny files containing similar contents as the above. I also take part in the "Bill" and "Apartment" modules but nothing is worth mentioning.

It's a pity that my other C# projects including Windows Forms were all lost after I changed my laptop, and those projects had been done long ago (since 2016 or 2017). This is the only project that relates to the C# .NET that I can show you, wish you can consider me for the C# Fresher Developer position.

If you are still confused about my ability, may I ask for a short training period? Please give me your response by this email [thonglt96@gmail.com] or through Mr.Thanh as you usually do.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
